# german-example-sentences

Bulk add example sentences to aid language study

To study japanese I have used https://apps.ankiweb.net/ for several years now. It's a great tool, and there are some fantastic plugins out there.

Context is super important when studying a language, and an excellent one has been made already to do this for Japanese: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2413435972 

Unfortunately there don't seem to be equivalents for other languages I have searched for.

# How to use

After some cleanup this will be submitted to anki plugins site.
Currently attempting to work with "unclean cards" i.e. "quirlig, lebendig, lebhaft, spritzig",  "auf jdn/etw verzichten".

It's functional right now however if your cards are clean (have a single german word):
- download the files
- add to you anki addons folder
- load up anki
- tag all flashcards with german words in the 'Front' note
- create a tag on your set: 'testing'
- Tools > test

For ~1000 cards it should complete within a minute or two.

# Resources

https://tatoeba.org/eng/downloads for example sentences. The pickle in this repo was created by:
- filter german sentences
- filter german sentences by native speakers
- filter german sentences with an english translation

If anyones interested can add this code at a later date. Would be useful if creating a further plugin not just for german -> eng
